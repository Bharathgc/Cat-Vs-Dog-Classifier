## Cat-Vs-Dog-Classifier

This is a classifier built to classify cats and dogs images. I have used Convolution Nueral Network to train the model and classify. 
I have also used  ImageDataGenerator class from Keras. Itâ€™s generate batches of image(matrix) data with real-time data augmentation(image processing). The data will be looped over (in batches) indefinitely.

### DataSet:
Download the DataSet from Kaggle  using the link [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data)

### Steps to Run:

Download or `git clone` the repository. 
- Download the data set and extract the `Train` and `Test` data in the same folder as the code
- Create a folder `training_data` with 2 sub folders `cats` and `dogs`.
- Then run the code

### Pre-requisites:

- Python 3 or above
- Keras
- Numpy
- OpenCV
